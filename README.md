## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



## ðŸ”¬ Active Research Projects  
These are the main research projects Iâ€™ve focused on during the last semesters of my masterâ€™s degree. Both projects aim to lead to publications (and the master thesis is still in its early stages). Repositories are currently private but will be made public once the work is finalized.  

### ðŸš¦ Masterâ€™s Thesis: VLM-based Detection of Safety-Critical Events in Traffic  
*(in progress, core of my masterâ€™s thesis)*  

**Goal**  
- Use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect and retrieve safety-critical or anomalous driving events from raw traffic video.  
- Application domain: autonomous driving and intelligent transport systems.  

**Methods**  
- Build multimodal pipelines combining video understanding with natural language descriptions.  
- Evaluate how well VLMs understand dynamic scene attributes and semantic context.  

**Status**  
- Currently under development (Thesis Timeline: August â€“ January)  

### ðŸ“ˆ News Market Impact Analysis  
*(finished project, research paper in preparation)*  

**Goal**  
- Investigate how macroeconomic news and central bank communications affect option-implied risk measures (variance, skewness, kurtosis).  

**Methods**  
- High-frequency regressions on S&P 500 options across ~195 news categories.  
- Address econometric challenges such as skewed distributions, multicollinearity, and ensure robustness using Lasso/Ridge.  

**Tools**  
- Python pipeline for preprocessing and regression analysis.  
- Interactive Plotly dashboard for quantifying impacts, highlighting influential news sets, and analyzing effects across maturities.  




### ðŸ§  Machine Learning / Data Analytics Projects  
*(First steps into ML and CV â€” mostly small projects in Python, exploring training, object detection pipelines, and data analysis)*  

These projects reflect my growing interest in machine learning and data science. They arenâ€™t large-scale systems, but each one was a way to practice different methods and tools, mostly with a focus on computer vision.  

- [Traffic-Video-Anonymizer](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Traffic-Video-Anonymizer)  
  Tool for research and dataset publication: automated, configurable anonymization of traffic videos.  

- [Multi-Camera-Stream-Intersection-Finder](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Multi-Camera-Stream-Intersection-Finder)  
  Pipeline for automatically retrieving intersection footage across multiple cameras.  

- [Captcha-Code-Classifier](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Captcha-Code-Classifier)  
  Small project for classifying CAPTCHA images with neural networks.  

- [Graph-based-Environmental-Treaty-Analysis](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Graph-based-Environmental-Treaty-Analysis)  
  University project using graph-based methods to analyze international environmental treaties.  



### ðŸŽ“ Legacy / Early Learning Projects  
*(Pre-AI era â€” Learning to Code during my Bachelors degree)*  

These are some small older projects I worked during University projects and for fun. 

- [TM4C-MQTT-Controller-IoT-Project](https://github.com/jbenzzz/TM4C-MQTT-Controller-IoT-Project)  
  Embedded C programming for distributed systems using an IoT setup with MQTT communication.  

- [Pong-game](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Pong-game)  
  A classic Pong clone developed in **C# with Unity**, experimenting with game development and physics.  

- [TRainingsplaner](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Trainingsplaner-)  
  Small **Java + JavaFX** desktop application for planning training sessions.
