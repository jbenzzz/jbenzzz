## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ§  Machine Learning / Data Analytics Projects  
*(First steps into ML and CV â€” mostly small projects in Python, exploring training, object detection pipelines, and data analysis)*  

These projects reflect my growing interest in machine learning and data science. They arenâ€™t large-scale systems, but each one was a way to practice different methods and tools, mostly with a focus on computer vision.  

- [Traffic-Video-Anonymizer](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Traffic-Video-Anonymizer)  
  Tool for research and dataset publication: automated, configurable anonymization of traffic videos.  

- [Multi-Camera-Stream-Intersection-Finder](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Multi-Camera-Stream-Intersection-Finder)  
  Pipeline for automatically retrieving intersection footage across multiple cameras.  

- [Captcha-Code-Classifier](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Captcha-Code-Classifier)  
  Small project for classifying CAPTCHA images with neural networks.  

- [Graph-based-Environmental-Treaty-Analysis](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Graph-based-Environmental-Treaty-Analysis)  
  University project using graph-based methods to analyze international environmental treaties.  



### ðŸŽ“ Legacy / Early Learning Projects  
*(Pre-AI era â€” Learning to Code during my Bachelors degree)*  

These are some small older projects I worked during University projects and for fun. 

- [TM4C-MQTT-Controller-IoT-Project](https://github.com/jbenzzz/TM4C-MQTT-Controller-IoT-Project)  
  Embedded C programming for distributed systems using an IoT setup with MQTT communication.  

- [Pong-game](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Pong-game)  
  A classic Pong clone developed in **C# with Unity**, experimenting with game development and physics.  

- [TRainingsplaner](https://github.com/jbenzzz/Trainingsplaner-)  
  Small **Java + JavaFX** desktop application for planning training sessions.
